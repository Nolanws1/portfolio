# portfolio
This Project consists of three different html pages:

An ABOUT ME page where welcome the viewer, introduce myself, and explain the purpose of my deployed website.

A PORTFOLIO page where the viewer can use a Carousel (by Bootstrap) to see picture-screenshots of my other projects and the date that the page was last updated. This page also features a "Coming Soon" section where I will share the title and date of any upcoming projects.

A CONTACT ME page where I have placed three cards (by Bootstrap) that link directly to three methods of contact. Linkedin, Github, and Email. Links are accessed through the card buttons.

The site has been formated for iphone(6/7/8/9/10/X), iPad, and most web browsers.
